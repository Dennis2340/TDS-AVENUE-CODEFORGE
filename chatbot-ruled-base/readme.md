# Rule-Based Chatbot

This is a simple rule-based chatbot created using Python and the NLTK library. The chatbot responds to user input based on predefined patterns and responses.

## Features

- Rule-based responses using NLTK's Chat utility
- Customizable conversation patterns

## Prerequisites

Before running this chatbot, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- NLTK library

## Installation

2. Install the required dependencies:
3. Download the necessary NLTK data:


## Usage

To run the chatbot, execute the following command in your terminal:
    *python main.py*


The chatbot will greet you and wait for your input. Type your messages and press Enter to receive responses. To exit the chat, you can typically use CTRL+C or follow any exit commands defined in your rules.

## Project Structure

- `main.py`: The main script that runs the chatbot
